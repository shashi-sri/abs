        Developed and Deployed OMS changes (OR, OC) related to Ecomm Promo Code (SC).
Divisions Games (SC & GR) offer request and offer creation functionality is now available in OMS.
Once EDM is live with their code (between the April 4th to 6th 2023) - business will be able to create the Offer Requests and Offers in OMS.
Enhanced capability in OMS to enter NOPA #'s starting with a 6, 7, 8 & 9 (limited to 7 digits total).
EDM: Code fix to ensure that Offer updates (in specific cases identified by the 'Liquor Rewards' issue) make their way to the Offer in stores.
Offer integrity: Teams (OMS, EDM, EPE) continued to huddle to do a POC for the solution to have a dashboard to flag offer integrity issues.
